By default, Quarto does not localize quotation marks in HTML documents even if you specify a language with `lang:` in the document header. In German for example we use curved quotation marks -- on the level of the commas as an opening mark and at the level of apostrophes as a closing mark[^1].

[^1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark>

To solve this problem, you need to use a Lua-filter for Pandoc, which converts your document to html.

1.  Download the `pandoc-quotes.lua` file from the Pandoc filters repository: https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/blob/master/pandoc-quotes.lua/pandoc-quotes.lua and store it in your Quarto project folder.
2.  Modify the YAML header of your Quarto document:

``` yaml
---
format: html
filters: 
  - pandoc-quotes.lua
lang: de
---

# Quotation Test

"Quotation please!"

'Small quotation please!'
```
