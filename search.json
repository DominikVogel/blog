    "text": "By default, Quarto does not localize quotation marks in HTML documents even if you specify a language with lang: in the document header. In German for example we use curved quotation marks – on the level of the commas as an opening mark and at the level of apostrophes as a closing mark1.\nTo solve this problem, you need to use a Lua-filter for Pandoc, which converts your document to html."
